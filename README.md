--> Did you know that the original name for the programming language "Python" was not inspired by the snake, but rather by the British comedy group Monty Python? The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, was a fan of the group and decided to name his language after them. In fact, the language's official documentation has numerous references to Monty Python sketches and jokes.
